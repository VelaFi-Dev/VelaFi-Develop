# Activate Merchant Account

This endpoint is used to activate a merchant's fiat currency payment account. Supported currencies include MXN, ARS, BRL, COP, PEN, USD, and EUR. Once activated, merchants can send and receive funds through local banking channels with increased flexibility and efficiency.

* Each merchant will receive dedicated account details (e.g., ARS accounts include CVU number / CUIT for Argentina).
* Merchants can deposit funds via wire transfer; VelaFi will automatically reconcile the transaction and credit the merchant’s account balance.
* Both business and personal account types are supported, enabling broad use across various payment scenarios.
