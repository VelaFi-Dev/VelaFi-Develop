# Limits

To meet compliance requirements, **VelaFi** applies different transaction and withdrawal limits based on the user’s region and verification level. This ensures that all users operate within the regulatory framework of their respective jurisdictions.

### 1Default Merchant Wallet Limit

After successfully creating a **Merchant**, VelaFi automatically provisions a **crypto custody wallet** for that merchant.

* The wallet is activated upon creation.
* The default **monthly withdrawal limit** is **USD 15,000**.

### 2. Individual Users

VelaFi classifies individual users into two categories — **Consumers** and **Professionals**, each with different verification requirements and transaction limits.

#### Consumers

* Requires minimal documentation for verification.
* Quick review process, with lower transaction limits.
* Suitable for low-frequency or small-value payment use cases.

| Country       | Monthly Trade Limit (USD) |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 🇲🇽Mexico    | 3,000                     |
| 🇧🇷Brazil    | 3,000                     |
| 🇨🇴Colombia  | 3,000                     |
| 🇵🇪Peru      | 3,000                     |
| 🇦🇷Argentina | 1,200                     |

#### Professionals

* Requires more comprehensive identity and business documentation.
* Subject to enhanced compliance review.
* Suitable for high-volume merchants or users requiring higher operational limits.

(Limits vary by jurisdiction and are subject to approval by the VelaFi compliance team.)

### 3. Business Users (After Channel Activation)

For business merchants, limits are applied per country once the corresponding fiat payment channels are activated.

| Country           | Monthly Limit (USD) |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| 🇲🇽Mexico        | 10,000              |
| 🇨🇴Colombia      | 10,000              |
| 🇦🇷Argentina     | 10,000              |
| 🇧🇷Brazil        | 10,000              |
| 🇵🇪Peru          | 10,000              |

### 4. Increasing Your Limit
